  <p>Title: Monarch Butterfly Decline in the U.S. Justification: The
  loss of biodiversity is something that we are seeing more and more of
  as climate change worsens. This topic is one that I have experience
  observing back home in New York. Throughout the past 20 or so years,
  there has been a heavy decrease in the amount of monarch sightings
  across the country, with an estimated 81% decline in monarchs from
  1999 to 2010
  (<xref alt="Pleasants &amp; Oberhauser, 2013" rid="ref-pleasants2013milkweed" ref-type="bibr">Pleasants
  &amp; Oberhauser, 2013</xref>). Monarch population decline is linked
  to the decline of milkweed population, as they feed primarily on this.
  Long-term plant surveys have been utilized to evaluate the correlation
  of milkweed and monarchs, which found a 68% loss of milkweed available
  to monarchs (Zaya,2017). This is a significant problem because
  monarchs are on track to become endangered and extinct, and if the
  statistics and data show this a main contributor for the decline of
  milkweed, we can change that and hopefully bring back the population
  of monarchs and avoid a loss of species and more biodiversity.
  Research objective/question/hypothesis: Decline in milkweed growth
  leads to the decline of monarch populations in the U.S. Prosed
  Methods: The variables I would like to measure are monarch population,
  milkweed growth within the U.S., and a time span of 20 years. I will
  perform a statistic test to determine their correlation based on the
  data that I find. I will also plot the results I get. I will look at
  the data.gov and on Nature Scientific Data, to find datasets that show
  the monarch and milkweed correlation. I will also look at DataCite for
  more data. This scope will be within the U.S. Before I start with my
  correlation tests, I will assess normality and skewness in the data,
  and make adjustments to clean the data if necessary. Expected
  Outcomes: I would expect to find that there is a statistically
  significant value that shows a positive correlation between milkweed
  and monarch population.</p>
